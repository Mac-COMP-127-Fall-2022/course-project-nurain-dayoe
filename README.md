## Technical Requirements : 

The program requires Java 17 or later.
The main method is located in MazeGame.java. 

## Known Issues : 

Limitations : 

Canvas window components are heavy and can be slow and sluggish on computers with lower processing power. When there are many enemies on the screen, frame rates drop. The enemies are also not very intelligent and get stuck easily. 

There is no way to tell which level the player is on. Similarly, there is no scoring system. The game generates a new maze with each level, but it does not get progressively harder with subsequent levels.

Minimap only works for the first level. Due to an issue with a Kilt Graphics method, minimap can only display the first generated maze. We decided to keep the minimap only for the first level, which makes the game more challenging for levels after that. 

Bugs : 

The game canvas can get cropped to incorrect ratios when this game is played on a smaller screen. Enemies' movement can randomly stop and get stuck. 

## Societal impact

Our game follows a character that appears as a white male with no option to change the characterâ€™s appearance. The game has no sound and does not support VoiceOver making it unplayable for people with low vision or blindness. Colors are not customizable, which might make it difficult to differentiate between the road and walls for some players. Sizes are not customizable either, and some players may experience motion sickness from the scrolling animations. Enemies may move too quickly for some players, making it difficult to win.
